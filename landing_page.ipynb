    "## Abstract\n",
    "This [Sim2L](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264492) allows researchers to share their density functional theory calculations performed using atomate2 and make the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this tool is used to cache the individual steps that compose a workflow. Using the atomate2 and FireWorks terminology, each green box in the diagram below represents a *firework*, or individual step, while the overall diagram is a *workflow*. Users can upload their atomate2 workflows, and the Sim2L stores the intermediate steps, and provides the final outputs of the workflow, along with relevant metadata. The fireworks containing VASP runs are not stored directly in this tool, but instead in nanoHUB's [vaspingestor tool](https://nanohub.org/tools/vaspingestor).\n",
